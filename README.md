# Game Theory in Python

I made this repository for exploring implementation of game theory algorithms. Game theory was one of the most interesting explanations of international relations that I encountered during my undergraduate studies in political science. As it's one of the more quantifiable theories, I want to start exploring implementations and possible machine learning integration to make more effective decision making.
